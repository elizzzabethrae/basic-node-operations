1. Run and explain sort, wc, and uniq commands on commands.js file

Sort: running `sort commands.js` returns each line in the file commands.js sorted alphabetically. It returns a lot of }'s at the end :)

Wc: running `wc commands.js` returns 41     113    1026 commands.js
It is showing the newline, word, and byte counts for the file.

Uniq: running `uniq commands.js` returns each unique line in the file. This returns all of the lines of code I inputted, because those are unique, but only returns one }, break;, etc. 

2. Running `wc commands.js | uniq` returns: 41     113    1026 commands.js
This is showing that for the unique lines in the file commands.js, here are the number of lines, word, and byte count.

6.

var reverseString = (inputString) => {
  var newArray = inputString.split('');
  return newArray.reverse().join('');
};
